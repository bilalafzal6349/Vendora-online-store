When the API is unavailable, the chatbot uses real product data:

- **Product questions**: Lists actual categories and product counts
- **Cart questions**: Mentions real popular products
- **Pricing questions**: Provides accurate price ranges and sale information

### 3. **Accurate Responses**

The chatbot can now answer questions like:

- "What's the price of the iPhone 15 Pro?" ‚Üí "$999 (on sale from $1099)"
- "What electronics do you have?" ‚Üí Lists actual products with prices
- "Are there any sales?" ‚Üí Lists current sale items with discounts
- "What's the cheapest product?" ‚Üí Can find actual lowest price
